# bikesharing

## Overview of Project
New York City's biksharing program, CitiBike, 2018 data was used to help create a visual pitch deck to potential investors. The NYC data is used to see if Des Moines will also be a suitable city for this bike sharing program. Tableau is used to analyze and display the data across different segments. We analyze checkout times and weekly hour usage across genders. Heatmaps and line graphs are the most used feature.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine if Des Moines will be suitable for a bikesharing program.

Most bikes fall within checkout times of 2-22 minutes for all genders. Males have the most check out times compared to females and unknown genders. The male’s highest duration is 5 minutes with over 108k bikes. Female’s is 6 minutes with over 34k bikes. Unknown genders are 11 minutes with over 7k bikes.

Weekday usage is most common in two intervals, morning and evening. This is most likely Monday Friday and would explain users taking a bike on their commute to work. Saturday and Sunday are common in one interval between 10am and 6pm. Bike usage is high through this entire time. Males and females’ usage is consistent with overall findings with one exception. Males are predominantly heavy users. When looking at customers vs subscribers, there is no gender distribution for customers. Subscribers have more predominately male users with most used days being Thursday and Friday.
